-- memory is partitioned
-- permanent storage: global var, prog instruction,


types: 
malloc- all memory allocation is done in bytes(contains garbage value)
calloc- contiguous memory allocaion(contains 0 as default value)
realloc- malloc or calloc must be used in prior
free- releases the specified block of memory bck to the system(indepent only but w/o any prior memory allocation, it is useless)

DATA STRUCTUR:
1.primitive(data types)
2.non-primitive
    1.linear:
        static(array)
        dynamic(linked list; doubly linked list, stack, queue)
    2.non-linear
        tree
        graph



performance:
worst case ;    average case ;  best case
1.time complexity- how many times the statement gets executed
2. space complexity-
