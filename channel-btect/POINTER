-- pointer variable must be initalized
-- pointer w/o any initialization is wild pointer
-- syntax:   dtype *ptr_var 
-- pointer var can't be initalized to a integer value, but can be init with the value 0
   wrong: int *p=10
   correct: int *p=0
-- all the address are whole number; size of the pointer is always the integer
-- sizeof the pointer is fixedd wrt the compiler
-- void pointeris a centralized pointer
-- null pointer is empty
